# Dynamic Resource Allocation for Servers Using CUDA

## Overview
This project implements a **high-performance dynamic resource allocation system** for **server environments**. The system is designed for **cloud computing, HPC (High-Performance Computing), AI inference, and distributed databases**.

## Features
- **Real-time task scheduling** for multi-GPU and CPU workloads.
- **CUDA-optimized dynamic memory management** for server applications.
- **Scalable load balancing** across cloud-based and on-premise servers.
- **Low-latency resource allocation** using **persistent kernels and CUDA streams**.
- **Kubernetes-ready for containerized environments**.

## Why It’s Challenging
- **Dynamic workloads:** Servers handle unpredictable tasks (AI, ML, DB queries).
- **Load imbalance:** Optimizing allocation across multiple CPUs.
- **Latency-sensitive operations:** Ensuring rapid scheduling with **microsecond response times**.
