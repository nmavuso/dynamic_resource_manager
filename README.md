# QoS Compliance Prediction in Server Configurations

This repository contains a robust Python code base for predicting Quality of Service (QoS) compliance in server configurations using machine learning. The project includes modules for data loading, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization. Additionally, it provides a script to generate synthetic test data that simulates real-world server performance.

## Overview

The experimental pipeline aims to:
- **Generate or load server configuration data:** Simulate various hardware and software configurations along with QoS performance metrics.
- **Preprocess the data:** Scale numerical features and one-hot encode categorical features.
- **Train a machine learning model:** Use models like Random Forest or Decision Tree to predict whether a server configuration meets QoS requirements.
- **Evaluate the model:** Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and plot an ROC curve for visual performance assessment.
- **Generate synthetic test data:** Create CSV files with synthetic data for testing and further experimentation.
